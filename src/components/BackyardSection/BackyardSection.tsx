                    Soak up the sun by the private pool, grill up something
                    delicious in the outdoor kitchen or try your hand at some
                    corn hole. There's a playground for the little ones and cozy
                    patio spots for evening chats by the fire. Whether it's a
                    laid-back BBQ or a lively summer gatheringâ€”our backyard is
                    made for making memories!
